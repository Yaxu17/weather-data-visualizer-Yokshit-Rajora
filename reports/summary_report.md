# Weather Data Visualizer — Summary Report

## 1. Introduction
This project analyses real-world weather data to identify trends in temperature, rainfall, and humidity. Using Python, the dataset was cleaned, processed, visualized, and summarized.

---

## 2. Data Cleaning
- Converted date column to datetime format  
- Filled missing temperature with mean  
- Filled missing rainfall with 0  
- Filled missing humidity with median  
- Created cleaned CSV file  

---

## 3. Statistical Insights

### Daily Statistics
Daily mean and standard deviation of temperature and humidity were calculated using NumPy and Pandas.

### Monthly Statistics
- Temperature shows a clear rise between March–June  
- Maximum rainfall occurs during July–August  

### Yearly Statistics
Yearly averages provide a smooth long-term view of climate patterns.

## 4. Visualizations
### 📌 Daily Temperature Trend  
Shows slight fluctuations and clear seasonal cycles.

### 📌 Monthly Rainfall  
Monsoon months show significantly higher rainfall.

### 📌 Humidity vs Temperature  
A positive correlation is observed.

### 📌 Combined Plot  
Provides an overview of rainfall and temperature together.

## 5. Grouping and Aggregation
Data grouped by seasons shows:

- **Summer:** highest temperatures  
- **Monsoon:** highest rainfall  
- **Winter:** lowest humidity  

---

## 6. Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of Python for real weather data analysis. Trends reveal seasonal behaviour, rainfall peaks, and temperature patterns that support climate awareness initiatives.
